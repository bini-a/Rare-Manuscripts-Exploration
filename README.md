# Rare Manuscripts Exploration Web App

Visit the Web App Built using Streamlit  [here](https://bini-a-rlapp-app-wr9dr6.streamlit.app/)


The project explored digitized cards from the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library's physical card catalogs to unearth historically marginalized voices in the collections. It includes the creation of a structured dataset, comprehensive analyses to understand the demographic and historical significance of the data, and a Streamlit-built web application for an interactive data exploration experience.

This web app was created as a final deliverable for the Duke Data+ 2021 Rubenstein Library Card Catalog File team. For more information on our project, visit our project [repository](https://github.com/bini-a/Data--Rubenstein-Library-Card-Catalog).
